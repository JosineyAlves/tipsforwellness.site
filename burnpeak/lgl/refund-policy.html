			<h1>Refund & Returns Policy</h1>
			<p>You have a generous 60-day period from the date your order is shipped to try out our product and experience its benefits. We are confident that, like many of our satisfied customers, you'll find great value in it and look forward to reordering when you need more.</p>
			<p>We suggest that you use the product for as long as possible before considering a refund request, giving it adequate time to produce results. You are fully entitled to take advantage of the extensive guarantee period to assess the product's effectiveness, and we encourage you to do so. However, if you find that the product doesn't meet your expectations, you can easily reach out to us for a refund.</p>
			<p>To process your refund smoothly, please follow the straightforward 3-step process outlined below:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Verify the Guarantee Period:</b> Ensure that you are still within the 60-day guarantee period from the shipping date of your order. You can confirm the shipping date by checking your email or the packing slip included with your order.</li>
				<li><b>Contact Us for a Refund:</b> Send us an email to let us know you're requesting a refund. Please include "Refund Request" in the subject line of your email, so we can direct your inquiry to the right team member promptly.</li>
				<li><b>Return Your Product:</b> Mail back all bottles, whether empty or unopened, to the returns address provided below. No return label is necessary, but you will need to cover the return postage cost. Be sure to email us the tracking ID for your return to help us process it more efficiently.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Add a note to your order that includes:</p>
			<ul><li>Your full name</li>
				<li>Your order number (check your email for this)</li>
				<li>Your email addressed used for your order</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Include the following details with your return:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Your full name</li>
				<li>Your order number (found in your email confirmation)</li>
				<li>The email address you used to place your order</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Returns address: <b>19655 E 35th Dr #100, Aurora, CO 80011</b></p>
			<p>Before returning your order, make sure to contact our support team and receive confirmation from an agent. Failure to do so could result in complications with locating your return and may delay your refund.</p>
			<p>Once we have received and processed your returned items, a full refund will be issued. You will receive an email confirmation when your refund has been processed, which typically takes 5-10 business days to appear on your financial statement.</p>
			<h3>How to Contact Us</h3>
