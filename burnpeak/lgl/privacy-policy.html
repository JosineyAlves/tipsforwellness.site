			<h3>Acceptance and Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>By using this Site, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. As the online environment evolves, we may update this policy in the future. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date." Your continued use of the Site signifies acceptance of any modifications made to this policy.</p>
			
			<h3>How We Collect and Use Information</h3>
			<p>We may collect and store personal information you provide while using the Site (e.g., during registration, purchases, or when subscribing to our content). The information may include your name, email address, postal address, and payment details. This data is submitted voluntarily by you.</p>
			<p>Additionally, we may collect data that is generated automatically as you browse the Site, such as information about your device's connection to the Internet, which helps us enhance your browsing experience and monitor site traffic. We may use cookies and web beacons to collect information. Cookies are small files placed on your device to help us track usage patterns, deliver targeted advertisements, and save your preferences. Web beacons (also known as "transparent GIFs") may be used to monitor site traffic or count users who have opened certain emails.</p>
			<p>We use the collected data to customize features, send you relevant offers, and provide you with tailored advertising through various means, including email, direct mail, phone, or SMS. We may also share your information with trusted third parties, such as service providers or advertisers. If you do not want us to use your information for these purposes, you can request removal by contacting our Online Privacy Coordinator at the address provided at the end of this policy.</p>
			<p>Please be cautious when sharing your personal information on public forums, message boards, or chat areas on the Site, as we cannot control how others may use that information.</p>

			<h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
			<p>We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). The Site only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended one of our events, or have purchased one of our products. The Site collects personally identifying information from our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail address for registration or opt-in purposes and name, postal address, and credit card information when registering for our events or purchasing our products. All of this information is provided to us by you.</p>
			<p>We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.</p>
			<p><u>No Information Collected from Children:</u> We will never knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected Personal Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its database.</p>
			<p><u>No sensitive medical information is collected:</u> We do not collect information about past, present or potential future medical conditions or treatments.</p>
			<p><u>Credit Card Information and Bank Account Information:</u> We may, in certain instances, collect credit card number(s), bank account information and related information, when you place an order on our website. When the credit card or bank account information is submitted to us, such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. We will use the credit card information or bank account information for purposes of processing and completing the transaction you requested. Such information will be disclosed to third parties as necessary to complete the requested purchase transaction.</p>		
			
			<h3>How We Store Your Information</h3>
			<p>Your information is stored at the list server that delivers the Site content and messaging. Your information can only be accessed by those who help manage those lists in order to deliver e-mail to those who would like to receive the Site material.</p>
			<p>All of the messaging or emails that are sent to you by the Site include an unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any time from our mailing list by clicking on the unsubscribe link that can be found in every communication that we send you.</p>
			<p>We endeavor to safeguard and protect your information. When you submit information on our website, such information is protected both online and offline. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal information under our control. The servers in which we store your information are kept in a secure physical environment. The servers have industry standard firewalls. Access to such servers is password protected and access by our employees is limited. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer software (“SSL”) to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts information including credit card number(s), and names and addresses, as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that, although we take commercially reasonable technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure; therefore, we cannot and do not warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our website is at your own risk. However, access to your information is strictly limited and not accessible to the public.</p>
			
			<h3>Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>We reserve the right to make material changes to the substance of this Privacy Policy. We will post those changes through a prominent notice on the website, so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.</p>

			<h3>California Residential Rights</h3>
			<p>California residents have the right to receive, once a year, information about third parties with whom we have shared information about you or your family for their marketing purposes during the previous calendar year, and a description of the categories of personal information shared. In addition California residents have the right to know if we respond to do not track signals or cookies. We do not respond to such signals or cookies.</p>
			<p>As stated in this Policy, you have agreed to allow us to share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes until you remove your information; and thus, you have agreed to this disclosure. California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:support@burnpeak.com" class="link-text">support@burnpeak.com</a>. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.</p>

			<h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing Information with Others</h5>
			<p>We share your information with third parties who help us in the delivery of the products and services you have requested. We share your information with companies and individuals we employ to perform technical functions on our behalf. Examples include third parties who host our website, analyze our data, provide marketing assistance, process credit card payments, and provide customer service. We share your information with third parties who will provide you with their opportunities, products or services. This includes your personal and non-personal information, and includes your interests and preferences, so they may determine whether you might be interested in their products or services. We share aggregated anonymous information about you, combined with other persons using our website with third parties, so that they can understand the kinds of visitors that come to our website, and how those visitors use our website. This includes demographic information and behavioral information.</p>
			<p>We disclose your information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion, pursuant to a request from a governmental entity, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property, or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.</p>
			<p>Finally, we may disclose and transfer your information to a third party who acquires any or all of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In the event we become the subject of an insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our liquidator, administrator, receiver or administrative receiver may sell, license or otherwise dispose of, such information in a transaction approved by the court.</p>

			<h3>Third Party Collection and Use of Information</h3>
			<p>Our Site may include advertisements from third-party advertisers who may use cookies, email, or web beacons to collect information about your browsing habits. These third-party advertisers have their privacy policies, which may differ from ours. We encourage you to review their privacy policies if you have any concerns.</p>
			<p>The Site may also contain links to external websites, and if you access these third-party sites, their privacy policies govern how they handle your information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these external websites.</p>
			<p>Third parties collect and use information about you on or through our website in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Advertisers: Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies who place ads on our website may use their own cookies, Web beacons, and other technology to collect information about you. We do not control the use of such technology and have no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about you.</li>

			</ul>

			<h3>How We Use Information Collected</h3>
			<p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features; advertising that appear on the Site; and, making other offers available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors and third-party publishers and advertisers for a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties.</p>
			<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online — for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas — that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.</p>
			
			<h3>Cooperative Relationships with Third-Party Providers</h3>
			<p>Some content, products, or services available on our Site may be offered in collaboration with third-party providers.

If you have any concerns or questions about the privacy policy of one of our partners, please reach out to them directly.</p>
			
			<h3>Legal Compliance and Business Transfers</h3>
			<p>We may disclose your information if required by law or to protect the rights, safety, or property of our users or the public. In the event of a business transfer, such as a merger or sale of assets, user information may be part of the transferred assets.</p>

			<p>We do not use Facebook advertising data for purposes like retargeting, merging data across multiple campaigns, or sharing it with external networks. Data obtained from Facebook is treated confidentially and securely.</p>
			<h3>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
			<p>The GDPR, effective May 25, 2018, protects the data of European Union (EU) citizens. While we do not specifically target our marketing towards the EU, we respect the GDPR if the data you provide falls under its regulations.</p>
			<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have rights regarding access, correction, deletion, portability, and restriction of your data. To exercise these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@burnpeak.com" class="link-text">support@burnpeak.com</a>.</p>
			<h3>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h3>

			<p>California residents may request disclosure of collected personal information, opt out of data sharing, or request data deletion. For such inquiries, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@burnpeak.com" class="link-text">support@burnpeak.com</a>.</p>
