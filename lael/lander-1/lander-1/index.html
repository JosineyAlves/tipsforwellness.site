                <p>Hello, Health & Science viewers!</p>
                <p>Today, we have the pleasure of speaking with one of the most respected experts on natural metabolism and weight loss in the United States — and around the world.</p>
                <div class="doctor-intro">
                    <img src="images.webp" alt="Dr. Mark Hyman" class="doctor-photo">
                    <p>He's a well-known physician and researcher who has spent years studying how a simple change in the way we use gelatin can unlock the body's ability to burn fat naturally.</p>
                    <p>Throughout his career, he has helped thousands of women and men between 25 and 80 achieve real, lasting weight loss — without extreme diets, workouts, or expensive treatments.</p>
                    <p>It is with great pleasure that we welcome Dr. Mark Hyman today.</p>
                    <p>Doctor, we're happy you accepted our invitation to discuss such an important topic.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="doctor-quote">— Exactly, exactly. Good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here.<br>
                And today, I'm going to show everyone watching that belly fat might actually be the easiest fat to lose, once you understand how your metabolism really works.</p>
                <p>In fact, I'll demonstrate how a simple daily gelatin recipe — what experts now call "The Gelatin Trick" — can help any woman start burning fat naturally from her belly, arms, and thighs, even while sleeping.</p>
                <p>I'll also share the live experiment that went viral on television, where Science Bob and I showed how this gelatin formula melts fat right before your eyes.</p>
                <p>And for those who want to see exactly how it works at home, I've provided a free educational video below with the full step-by-step explanation.</p>
